abstract = {Napster pioneered the idea of peer-to-peer file sharing, and supported it with a centralized file search facility. Subsequent P2P systems like Gnutella adopted decentralized search algorithms. However, Gnutella's notoriously poor scaling led some to propose distributed hash table solutions to the wide-area file search problem. Contrary to that trend, we advocate retaining Gnutella's simplicity while proposing new mechanisms that greatly improve its scalability. Building upon prior research 1, 12, 22, we propose several modifications to Gnutella's design that dynamically adapt the overlay topology and the search algorithms in order to accommodate the natural heterogeneity present in most peer-to-peer systems. We test our design through simulations and the results show three to five orders of magnitude improvement in total system capacity. We also report on a prototype implementation and its deployment on a testbed.},

@article{Stoica2001,
abstract = {A fundamental problem that confronts peer-to-peer applications is to efficiently locate the node that stores a particular data item. This paper presents Chord, a distributed lookup protocol that addresses this problem. Chord provides support for just one operation: given a key, it maps the key onto a node. Data location can be easily implemented on top of Chord by associating a key with each data item, and storing the key/data item pair at the node to which the key maps. Chord adapts efficiently as nodes join and leave the system, and can answer queries even if the system is continuously changing. Results from theoretical analysis, simulations, and experiments show that Chord is scalable, with communication cost and the state maintained by each node scaling logarithmically with the number of Chord nodes.},

abstract = {Map Reduce is a parallel programming paradigm successfully used to perform computations on massive amounts of data, being widely deployed on clusters, grid, and cloud infrastructures. Interestingly, while the emergence of cloud infrastructures has opened new perspectives, several enterprises hesitate to put sensible data on the cloud and prefer to rely on internal resources. In this paper we introduce the PER-MARE initiative, which aims at proposing scalable techniques to support existent Map Reduce data-intensive applications in the context of loosely coupled networks such as pervasive and desktop grids. By relying on the Map Reduce programming model, PER-MARE proposes to explore the potential advantages of using free unused resources available at enterprises as pervasive grids, alone or in a hybrid environment. This paper presents the main lines that orient the PER-MARE approach and some preliminary results.},

abstract = {MapReduce is a programming model for parallel data processing widely used in Cloud computing environments. Current MapReduce implementations are based on centralized master-slave architectures that do not cope well with dynamic Cloud infrastructures, like a Cloud of clouds, in which nodes may join and leave the network at high rates. We have designed an adaptive MapReduce framework, called P2P-MapReduce, which exploits a peer-to-peer model to manage node churn, master failures, and job recovery in a decentralized but effective way, so as to provide a more reliable MapReduce middleware that can be effectively exploited in dynamic Cloud infrastructures. This paper describes the P2P-MapReduce system providing a detailed description of its basic mechanisms, a prototype implementation, and an extensive performance evaluation in different network scenarios. The performance results confirm the good fault tolerance level provided by the P2P-MapReduce framework compared to a centralized implementation of MapReduce, as well as its limited impact in terms of network overhead.},
