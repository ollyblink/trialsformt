There are two general types of draw dies.   The JRD-1 can be  made 
     either  for  bullets,  or for jackets.   The bullet draw die reduces  a 
     finished  bullet  by  a small amount,  sometimes as  little  as  0.0005 
     inches,  and  sometimes  as much as  0.003  inches.   However,  greater 
     reductions cause distortion of the bullet and are not feasible.  
          Jacket draw dies can reduce an existing jacket by a whole caliber.  
     This  is  the  way that .41 caliber jackets  are  obtained  today,  for 
     instance.   A  .44  caliber  jacket is pushed through a  draw  die  and 
     reduced  to .41 caliber.   This would not work with a  bullet.   Jacket 
     drawing  punches fit inside the jacket,  and actually push  it  through 
     base first, while bullet draw dies push the bullet through nose first.
          Special  versions of draw dies turn fired .22 cases into  .224  or 
     .243  caliber rifle jackets.   The .22 WMR case can be drawn to a  long 
     6mm jacket in another die,  and shotgun primers can be turned into free 
     .25 ACP jackets with another.   Draw dies perform a remarkable service. 
     Their  limitations  are  discussed in "REDISCOVER SWAGING"  in  detail.  
     Dies  ending in "R" fit the standard reloading press and have  a  punch 
     that  fits  into the press ram.   Dies ending in "M" fit the Mity  Mite 
     press,  and have a punch that screws into the press ram.   The die goes 
     into the press head,  replacing the floating punch holder.  Dies ending 
     in  "H" are made for the Corbin Hydro-press.   They have a  long  punch 
     that screws into the ram,  and the die fits into a 7/8-14 adapter which 
     in  turn fits the 1.5-12 thread of the press head,  also replacing  the 
     floating punch holder.
