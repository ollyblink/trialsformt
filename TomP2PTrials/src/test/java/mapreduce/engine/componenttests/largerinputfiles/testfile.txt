 A long time ago, in a city far-far away, two men had an insight.  Ward
Christensen and Randy Suess wanted a way to leave notes and messages to their
programmer/engineer friends.  Back then, modems were used by field-engineers and
some high-level executives to talk to their companies computers.  A 300 baud
modem was extremely fast, as most people were using 110 baud TeleTypes.  Ward
and Randy devloped the concept of the BBS.  They called it CBBS, for "Computer
Bulletin Board System." CBBS was the first of its kind.  It was an enormous
program written in 8080 assmebly language.  By our standards today, it was
kludgy and bug-ridden, but back then it was heavenly.  Users could enter
messages and read messages...  that was about it.
